Description: Contains several commands that are useful for sub setting data where the data frame contains coordinates. Each of the 4 functions generates a line between two provided sets of coordinates and will essentially cut a right triangle out of the data frame where the ends of the hypotenuse are the two provided coordinates. The draw_complex command will allow you to do this with more complex shapes consisting of 3 provided sets of coordinates. The plot_data function will plot the data frames you have created on a US map.
